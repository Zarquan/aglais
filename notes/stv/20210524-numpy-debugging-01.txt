    Target:

        Debug the numpy issue with the "5d kinematic clustering" notebook

    Result:

        Inconclusive / Success?
      
   	
# The below was run on a version of the notebook, checked out from the github wfau/aglais-notebooks repository on May 24
# https://github.com/wfau/aglais-notebooks/blob/7e69297d7da41be89018571186a8070943b2abcb/2G5VG3CKT/note.json

	# Run "Function definitions" cell
	# With the latest version of all libs (numpy 1.20.3) we get the following error

	>  AttributeError: 'numpy.ufunc' object has no attribute 'module'


	
   
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Downgrade numpy version


	# After changing the numpy version to 1.19.5, we no longer get an error
	# ..
	# However after further testing, if we then try to import hdbscan "python -c import hdbscan" we get the following error:

	 >  ValueError: numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 88 from C header, got 80 from PyObject`


	
   
	# -----------------------------------------------------
	# With the downgraded numpy version, now try downgrading hdbscan 
        # Start from the previous version, and work downwards.


        # ...

        > Various different errors depending on the version we test

        
        # .. Tried different combinations of hdbscan, numpy & scipy, none seem to work together
        # Could it be other libraries (pyspark?) that break this compatibility



   
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Try to understand what the cell that is failing is doing and debug


# Comment out line by line until we get to a version that works..
# After a long process of commenting out and modifying the py cells, it seems that the problematic line is:

    %pyspark
    from numpy import pi, cos, sin

     
# Some googling seems to imply that this step is attempting to pickle (serialize) some numpy functions that may be problematic

# FIX: 

    %pyspark
    from math import pi, cos, sin


# This cell now runs successfully. Is it possible that this gives us incorrect results in any way?


# For now revert requirements.txt file to use latest version of numpy, and test with this fix
