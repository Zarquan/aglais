## Set default python to python3
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10


## Upgrade pip
sudo /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip


## Install python libs that were missing
## hdbscan, astropy, healpy
sudo /usr/bin/python3.7 -m pip install hdbscan
sudo /usr/bin/python3.7 -m pip install astropy
sudo /usr/bin/python3.7 -m pip install healpy

## Additional libraries previously installed for future reference
sudo /usr/bin/python3.7 -m pip install pandas
sudo /usr/bin/python3.7 -m pip install requests


## Create matplotlib and astropy config dirs
## Not sure if this has to happen in a new install, but there were exceptions about these directories missing when running Spark notebook cells that included matplotlib or healpy imports
sudo mkdir -p  /home/.astropy/cache/download
sudo mkdir -p  /home/.astropy/config
sudo mkdir -p  /home/.cache/matplotlib

## Set permissions, make writable by all
chmod -R 777 /home/.astropy
chmod -R 777 /home/.cache/matplotlib

## Is this a security concern?



## Set Zeppelin Spark Python version
## In the Zeppelin admin GUI
## Set zeppelin.pyspark.python parameter to:  python3
