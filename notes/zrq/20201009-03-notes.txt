    Cluster create works :-)
    Monday-Thursday lost due to unknown issue on the Openstack platform.
    Need to track down what the cause was, and how likley is it to occur again.

    Our cpu quota has been increased.
    See if we can create a larger cluster, using all 200 cpu ?

    Automate the cluster config process to make it faster.
    Combine all the Helm charts into one set.

    Mount the existing Gaia share in Spark (rw for now).

    Create a share for Nigel to work with.
    Mount Nigel's share in K8s Spark nodes to test.
    Read the CephFS mount secrets from inside the K8s Pod.
    Mount Nigel's share in a VM, using CephFS fuse mount.
    Add that to Stelio's deployment for Nigfel to use.
