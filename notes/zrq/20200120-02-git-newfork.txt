    # Removing binary file from the upstream git repository changed the commit history.
    # Which means existing forks no longer match.#
    #

    # Attempting to create a PR returns an error :
    # There isnâ€™t anything to compare.
    # wfau:master and Zarquan:20200103-zrq-storage are entirely different commit histories.

    #
    # Easiest 'fix' is to create a new fork, and merge local changes.
    # If we need to do this in the futire - make sure everyone has merged their work into the main repository first.
    #

    #
    # Can't have two forks of the same repo in your account, so had to delete our original fork.
    # Then create a new fork of the upstream repo.
